# FreeStuff

FreeStuff is an App to discover and share free items in your neighborhood. Whether it’s a stack of books, a working lamp, or furniture someone left on the sidewalk — just open the map and see what's available nearby.

Features:
* Browse a live map of free finds: see pins for free stuff near you, complete with photos, descriptions, and exact locations.
* Post your own finds in seconds: Take a picture, write a quick note, and drop a pin. Help others give items a second life.
* Automatic removal when picked up: Once you’re close enough to pick up an item, the post disappears — no clutter, no spam.
* Join a growing community of local sharers: Freestuff helps reduce waste, save money, and connect neighbors through generous giving.

No sign-up required. No price tags. Just useful stuff, freely shared.
